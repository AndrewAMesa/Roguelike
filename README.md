The point of this game is to see how many levels you can last until you lose by running out of health. To move on to the next level you will be given one out of three tasks. These are to find either a portal, defeat enough enemies or defeat a boss which will appear every five levels. To harm the boss you need to stun it by making it charge against a wall. WASD or arrow keys will move the player and shift will have the player sprint for a short amount of time. Left-click activates your swords and right-click fires your gun, you gain one projectile for every five hits with the sword. The player points to wherever your cursor is on the screen. There are collectibles to heal and increase damage, traps to set off, and tiles that hurt you. There is a very unique position in which an enemy will stop following you but once you move some it will follow you again (bug).
