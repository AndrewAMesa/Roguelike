# roguelike
This is a roguelike game developed using the Python programming language and Pygame. Procedural generation is used to produce unique levels. The point of this game is to see how many levels you can last until you lose by running out of health. To move on to the next level you will be given one out of three tasks. These are to find either a portal, defeat enough enemies, or defeat a boss which appears every five levels. In the portal level your health will be lowered to 450, and in a boss level you cannot sprint. To harm the boss you need to stun it by making it charge against a wall. WASD or arrow keys will move the player, and shift will have the player sprint for a short amount of time. Left-click activates your swords, and right-click fires your gun. You gain one projectile for every five hits with the sword. The player points to wherever your cursor is on the screen. There are collectibles to heal and increase damage, traps to set off, and tiles that hurt you. There is a very rare position you can get enemies in which some enemies will stop chasing you, but moving around will get them to chase you again (bug).
